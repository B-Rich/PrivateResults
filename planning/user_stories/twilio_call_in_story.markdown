## User story

### As a
Clinic patient

### I want to...
Receive and understand my STD test results

### So that...
I can get treated, notify my partners, and/or stop freaking out

## User narrative
A patient goes to the clinic to get tested. They are handed a card at the end of the visit that gives them a phone number to call for their results, a date on which to call (typically a week after the day of testing), a numerical username, and a numerical password. The patient probably tries the next day, because they are anxious, but their results aren't ready. 

1. They dial the number on the card they were given.
1. They are prompted for their username, followed by the pound sign (or whatever). 
1. They enter their username from the card and press the pound sign.
1. They are prompted for their password, followed by the pound sign (or whatever). 
1. They enter the password from the card and press the pound sign.
1. They are read a message (the message will depend on their test results) and told to press "1" if they want to hear the message again.
1. They press 1.
1. They hear the message again.
1. They hang up and take the approporiate next steps.
