### Code contributions

*In the future, we plan to support git-flow*

As a general rule, we require test coverage for all new features. We
use RSpec for tests and also encourage you to document your code
according to YARD conventions.

1. Fork this repo on GitHub.
1. Add your feature with tests.
1. Add yourself to the CONTRIBUTORS file since you deserve credit and
   recognition for your contributions.
1. Make a pull request. When Travis-CI verifies that your pull request
   won't break anything, the maintainers will look it over and merge
   it in.
1. Also, it'd be awfully boss of you if you could try not to lower our
   Code Climate score by too much.
1. Pat yourself on the back for being a rockstar.

### Documentation

We use YARD for documentation and we could always improve the docs.

### Testing

According to coveralls.io, we have very high test coverage but that
doesn't make that our spec suite adequate. Any place you can add or
improve specs would provide huge assistance.
